The goal of cyclestreets is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of cyclestreets from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cyclestreets")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/cyclestreets")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# Install packages used below
install.packages("stplanr")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Robinlovelace/cyclestreets")
install.packages("mapview")

# Get start/finish points as geocoded points
library ("stplanr")
from = stplanr::geo_code ("Bradford")
to = stplanr::geo_code ("Leeds")

# Obtain bicycle route
# Get your key at https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/apply/
# Route types available are: fastest, quietest, balanced
library ("cyclestreets")
Sys.setenv (CYCLESTREET='your_key_here')
route = cyclestreets::journey (from, to, "fastest")

# Display on map
library ("mapview")
mapview::mapview(route)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
