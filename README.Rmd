# cyclestreets

The goal of cyclestreets is to provide a simple R interface to the CycleStreets routing service.

It was split-out from **stplanr** for modularity.

## Installation

You can install the released version of cyclestreets from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cyclestreets")
```

Install the development version with **devtools** as follows:

```{r installdev, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cyclestreets/cyclestreets-r")
```

## Example

A common need is to get from A to B:

```{r example}
library ("cyclestreets")
# stplanr::geo_code ("leeds rail station") 
from = c(-1.544, 53.794)
# stplanr::geo_code ("leeds university") 
to = c(-1.551, 53.807)
r = cyclestreets::journey(from, to, "balanced")
sf:::plot.sf(r)
```

To get a key go to <https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/apply/>

Save the key as an environment varible using `export CYCLESTREETS=your_key_here` by adding `CYCLESTREETS=your_key_here` as a new line in your `.Renviron` file, e.g. with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Check the map is good with leaflet:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
p = colorNumeric("RdYlBu", domain = r$busynance, reverse = TRUE)
leaflet(r) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addPolylines(color = ~p(busynance), weight = 20, opacity = 0.9) %>% 
  addLegend(pal = p, values = ~busynance)
```

Or **tmap**, highlighting the recently added 'quietness' variable:

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(r) + tm_lines("quietness", palette = "RdYlBu", lwd = 3, popup.vars = names(r)[-32])
```

See an interactive version of this map, showing all variables per segment, [here](https://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/784236).

Or **mapview**:

```{r}
mapview::mapview(r)
```

Route types available are: fastest, quietest, balanced.
See help pages such as `?journey` and <https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/> for details.

You can also get streets by LTN status.

```{r}
network_ltns <- ltns(r)
plot(network_ltns)
```
